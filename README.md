# RTLStructLib
Highly optimized, synthesizable data structures module/IP library for hardware design

### Overview
RTLStructlib is an open-source project providing a collection of synthesizable RTL data structures implemented at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL). These modules are designed for high performance, scalability, and ease of integration into digital systems, serving as a standard library for FPGA and ASIC engineers.
By using these pre-built RTL modules, engineers can accelerate development, reduce verification time, and focus on higher-level system design.

### Features
✅ Synthesizable, Optimized, Modular and Reusable <br>
✅ Fully parameterized <br>
✅ Comprehensive verification sequence and testbench <br>
✅ Verification Agent (WIP) <br>
✅ Open-source and community-driven <br>

### Supported Data Structures
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Queue – Parameterized depth, support for synchronous & asynchronous modes <br>
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) Stack – Configurable width and depth <br>
- Singly Linked List – Efficient memory utilization, dynamic data handling <br>
- Doubly Linked List – Bi-directional traversal support <br>
- Table - Indexed storage mechanism, similar to a register file, enabling rapid direct access and simultaneous read write access to data without hashing. <br>
- Circular Linked List （WIP） 
- Hash Table (WIP) – Optimized for high-speed lookups <br>
- Binary Tree (WIP) – Fundamental structure for hierarchical data organization <br>
- AVL Tree (WIP) – Self-balancing binary search tree for efficient operations <br>
- And More and More and More (WIP)
